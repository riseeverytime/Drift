WELCOME_TITLE="Welcome to Drift"
WELCOME_CONTENT="### Drift is a self-hostable clone of GitHub Gist. \nIt is a simple way to share code and text snippets with your friends, with support for the following:\n  \n  - Render GitHub Extended Markdown (including images)\n  - User authentication\n  - Private, public, and secret posts\n  \n  If you want to signup, you can join at [/signup](/signup) as long as you have a passcode provided by the administrator (which you don\'t need for this demo).\n  **This demo is on a memory-only database, so accounts and pastes can be deleted at any time.**\n  You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/MaxLeiter/drift).\n  \n  Drift was inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/emilyst/status/1499858264346935297):\n  > What is the absolute closest thing to GitHub Gist that can be self-hosted?\n    In terms of design and functionality. Hosts images and markdown, rendered. Creates links that can be private or public. Uses/requires registration. I have looked at dozens of pastebin-like things."
