## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in Drift!

### I want to report a bug

Look at the open and closed issues to see if this was not already discussed before. If you can't see any, feel free to open a new issue.
If you think you discovered a security vulnerability, do not open a public issue on GitHub. Please email maxwell.leiter@gmail.com in the interest of responsible disclosure.

### I want to contribute to the code

Make sure to discuss your ideas with the community in an issue or on the IRC channel.
Take a look at the open issues labeled as help wanted or good first issue if you want to help without having a specific idea in mind.
Make sure that your PRs do not contain unnecessary commits or merge commits. Squash commits whenever possible.
Rebase (instead of merge) outdated PRs on the master branch.
Give extra care to your commit messages. Use the imperative present tense and follow Tim Pope's guidelines.
